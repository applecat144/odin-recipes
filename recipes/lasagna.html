        <li>All purpose flour - 120g</li>
        <li>Milk - 1L</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Ground beef - 300g</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2 carots</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Thym & other aromatics</li>
        <li>Pepper and salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Making the pasta sheets</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the eggs into a large bowl and beat them until the whites and yolks are fully mixed.</li>
        <li>Add a handful of all purpose flour and mix it with the whisked eggs.</ul>
        <li>Add a good handful of flour on your table, pour the egg-flour mix on it, and start kneeding to incorporate more flour in the mix.</li>
        <li>Keep kneeding and adding gradually more flour until the dough gets really firm and barely stick to your hands and working surface.</li>
        <li>Let your dough rest for a few minutes. You can make your bechamel and your bolognaise before the next steps</li>
        <li>Cut your dough in several portions of the same size. The number of portions typically depends on the size of your plate, the usual familiy-sized plate will
            take 6 - 7 sheets.
        </li>
        <li>Start lowering the sheets with your rolling pin. The sheets need to be thin enough so you can easily see your hand through it when putting it underneath.</li>
        <li>Once you're done, let the sheets rest for a little while. You can prepare them in advance, but if you do so make sure to cover them so they don't get dry and crumbly</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Making the bechamel</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Put the butter into a saucepan, under medium fire, and let it melt. Make sure it doesn't burn in the process.
        </li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, progressively add the flour while mixing. You don't have to add all the flour, just add up so it gets a cakedough consistency.
            Don't add flour until it starts forming a ball, otherwise you'll struggle. Let it cook for a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add a first quarter of the milk and mix it with the roux, then add the reste of the mix, thoroughly mix, and wait for the bechamel to cook. Be wary that
            it doesn't burn at the bottom of the pan. At some point the bechamel should become stiffer and thicker. Turn the fire off and mix for a few minutes for it
            to cook.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Making the bolognaise</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a good amount of olive oil in a pan and heat it on medium-high fire.</li>
        <li>While the pan is getting hot, mince the carrots, then throw them in the pan. You don't want them to cook completely, you just need them to become a bit colored.</li>
        <li>Once the carrots are done, repeat the process with the onions.</li>
        <li>Finally, repeat the process with the ground beef.</li>
        <li>Then, add everything together with 400g of diced tomatoes and let it cook uncovered on low heat. What you want is most of the water out</li>   
    </ol>

    <h3>Preparing the lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>At the bottom of your plate, add a layer of bolognaise, then a sheet of pasta, then a layer of bechamel.</li>
        <li>Keep doing that until you run out of ingredients.</li>
        <li>On the last layer of pasta, add some grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake at 180°C for 10 to 15 minutes, with the few last minutes under the grill.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>And voilà ! You can enjoy your dish while its hot, and reheated leftovers are evon more delicious.</p>
